Postmortem: Outage on Website Login System

Issue Summary:
Duration: 2 hours, 30 minutes (10:00 AM - 12:30 PM EST)
Impact: The website's login system was down, preventing users from logging in and accessing their accounts. Approximately 75% of users were affected.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the website's load balancer. One of the backend servers had been taken offline for maintenance, but it was not properly removed from the load balancer pool. This caused traffic to be directed to the offline server, resulting in login failures for users.

Timeline:
10:00 AM - The issue was detected when multiple users reported login failures to the customer support team.
10:05 AM - The customer support team escalated the issue to the operations team.
10:10 AM - The operations team investigated the issue and identified that traffic was being directed to the offline server.
10:15 AM - The operations team attempted to restart the load balancer and backend servers, but the issue persisted.
10:30 AM - The operations team began investigating other potential causes, including issues with the database and application servers.
11:00 AM - The operations team discovered the misconfiguration in the load balancer and corrected it.
11:15 AM - The operations team verified that the login system was functioning properly and informed the customer support team.
12:30 PM - The outage was resolved and all systems were functioning normally.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer was caused by human error during the maintenance of the backend server. To prevent this from happening again, the operations team implemented a checklist for server maintenance that includes proper removal from the load balancer pool. Additionally, they updated the monitoring system to alert the team if any server is not responding and if there is any traffic going to an offline server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures were implemented:

1. Review and update the server maintenance checklist to include proper removal from the load balancer pool.
2. Implement regular load testing to ensure that the load balancer is functioning properly.
3. Enhance monitoring to include alerts for traffic directed to offline servers and server response issues.
4. Conduct regular training sessions for operations team members on best practices for server maintenance and monitoring.

Overall, the outage was caused by a human error that was not caught during routine maintenance procedures. The implementation of new preventative measures will reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and improve the overall reliability of the website's login system.
